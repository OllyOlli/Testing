SQL Beginner Project: Blood Bank Management

Task assignment:

Blood banks collect blood and send it to patients who need it. For this operation to function well, 
the blood bank must have good records of the donors and collected blood,
which can be compared to patient data. These records also ensure the bank has enough blood in its reserves.

For this project, you are to create a database for a blood bank.

The database should have records of donors, patients, and blood held in the blood bank’s stores. 

Relevant information for the different sets of records may be as follows:

Donors: Name, Phone No., Address, and Donation Location
Patient: Name, Illness/Injury, Blood Group, Allergies/Sensitivities
Blood: Blood Group, Donor, Medical Details

Additional details can be added if the database is for multiple blood banks.

Queries should be able to answer questions such as the availability of different blood types in the inventory, 
donations that match a patient’s needs, etc.
