Write a script that:
1) logs in as the user from task 1,

2) selects a Hummingbird Printed Sweater for purchase (additional option: checks if the discount for
it is 20%),

3) chooses size M (additional option: make it so that you can parametrize the size and choose
S,M,L,XL),

4) chooses 5 pieces according to the parameter given in the test (additional option: make it so that
you can parameterize the number of pieces),

5) adds the product to the cart,

6) goes to the checkout option,

7) confirms the address (you can add it manually beforehand),

8) chooses the delivery method - PrestaShop "pick up in store",

same as in the order two steps earlier.
